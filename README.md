# End-to-end Learning of Deterministic Decision Trees
Pytorch implementation of [End to end Learning of Deterministic Decision Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02743).  
I made tweaks to the original algorithm to use online-parameter-updates.
See my [tech blog (japanese)](https://qiita.com/itok_msi/items/b8b8b0e915533ece430a) for the details.
